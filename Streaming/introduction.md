# Introduction

In large enterprise application there are often use cases for message passing. In a use case for example one componoent must communicate directly with another or with more than one. Conclicts are possible in case of long running tasks. There are several solutions to handle these conflicts. Using a concept of mutual exclusion solves a conflict by blocking resources. So processes must wait until the resources are free to use. In this solution queues have to be processed. In large applications developers and administrators must take care of correct message passing. Also when it comes to failure, a supervision of the processes has to be applied. The maintanance and complexity of the application increases if more conflicts must be handled. Another solution is using streaming applications likee Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, Apache Flume or Apache S4. Still there are further Streaming Frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming. In the following chapters there will be a small introduction in Streaming Frameworks. The explaination are shown in a tutorial manner and after the practice was shown the theoretical side is discussed.
