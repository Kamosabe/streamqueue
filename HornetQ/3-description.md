## Description

###General
HornetQ is the successor of JBoss Messaging 1.x. The original development name was JBoss Messaging 2. Because of the huge differences on code base between HornetQ and JBoss Messaging 1.x the decision for a new name was made. 

The big advantage of HornetQ is that it is designed for large messages (several GB) and queues (more than one TB). Of course it could be easily integrated in JBoss-Components but it is also flexible usable with general java components.
