In the following it is explained how to install and run the stand-alone HornetQ server.

### Installation
 1. Download the latest release from http://www.jboss.org/hornetq/downloads.html

### Starting HornetQ
After the successful installation we have to run the HornetQ Server. Therefore it is necessary to open the Windows Console and to change to the installation directory:

    cd [hornetq_install_dir]

In that case [hornetq_install_dir] is the directory in which HornetQ was installed (e.g. C:\Program Files\HornetQ-2.x). 

Then you can run HornetQ by typing:

    bin\run.bat
