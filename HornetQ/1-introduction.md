# JBoss HornetQ
JBoss justifies the exclusive name with:
>Hornets are fast, angry and have attitude, with a sting in their tail.

>You don't mess with the hornet.
 
>Also they make great logos.

The following chapter will check if HornetQ is as fast as they describe.

## Introduction
At the moment of creating this document the last stable release was from April 24, 2013 in version 2.3.0. HornetQ is licensed by Apache Software License 2 to give developers all possibilities of extending and developing with it. 

The roadmap shows that HornetQ is to be as flexible as Apache ActiveMQ already is. Still today it supports several operating systems, communications protocols and server systems. Not least it is designed to work as well as possible with JBoss components.
