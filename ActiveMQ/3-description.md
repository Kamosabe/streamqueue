Next to the huge number of protocols ActiveMQ provides Client APIs for many **languages** including C/C++, .NET, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and more.

ActiveMQ uses **OpenWire** as its native wire protocol for exchanging messages between brokers and clients. It is designed to be an efficient binary protocol in terms of netwerk bandwidth and performance. It also implements AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), Stomp (Simple Text Oriented Message Protocol) and MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport).

 - Apache Tomcat
 - JBoss
 - Jetty
 - Spring Framework
